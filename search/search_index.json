The KS test plots the fraction of positives and negatives predicted correctly below each threshold. It then finds the optimal threshold, being the one enabling the best class separation. The area between curves allows a better insight into separation.

ROC: Plots true-positive rate as a function of the false-positive rate of the positive label in a binary classification, where TPR = TP / (TP + FN) TPR = TP / (TP + FN) and FPR = FP / (FP + TN) FPR = FP / (FP + TN) . A naive algorithm will display a linear line going from (0,0) to (1,1), therefore having an area under-curve (AUC) of 0.5. Precision-Recall: Plots precision as a function of recall of the positive label in a binary classification, where Precision = TP / (TP + FP) Precision = TP / (TP + FP) and Recall = TP / (TP + FN) Recall = TP / (TP + FN) . A naive algorithm will display a horizontal linear line with precision of the ratio of positive examples in the dataset.

If only one or two columns exist, the data is treated as a binary classification (see input example below).

Currently supported: 'roc' for Receiver Operating Characteristic curve and 'pr' for Precision-Recall curve micro : Boolean Default = True Whether to calculate a Micro graph (not applicable for binary cases) macro : Boolean Default = True Whether to calculate a Macro graph (ROC metric only, not applicable for binary cases) eopt : Boolean Default = True Whether to calculate and display the estimated-optimal threshold for each metric graph. For ROC curves, the estimated-optimal threshold is the closest computed threshold with (fpr,tpr) values closest to (0,1). For PR curves, it is the closest one to (1,1) (perfect recall and precision) class_names : list or string Default = None Names of the different classes. In a multi-class classification, the order must match the order of the classes probabilities in the input data. In a binary classification, can be a string or a list. If a list, only the last element will be used. colors : list of Matplotlib color strings or None Default = None List of colors to be used for the plotted curves.
